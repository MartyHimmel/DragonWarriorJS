<enemy> hath woken up.

Thou art dead.

"Thou art strong enough!
Why can thou not defeat the Dragonlord?"

"If thou art planning to take a rest, first see King Lorik."

<player name> held the Rainbow Drop toward the sky.
But no rainbow appeared here.

"Good morning.
Thou hast had a good night's sleep I hope."

"I shall see thee again."

"Good morning.
Thou seems to have spent a good night."

"Good night."

"Okay.
Good-bye, traveler."

"Welcome to the traveler's Inn.
Room and board is <number> GOLD per night.
Dost thou want a room?"

"All the best to thee."

"There are no stairs here."

"Thou cannot enter here."

"There is no one there."

"I thank thee.
Won't thou buy one more bottle?"

"Will thou buy some Fairy Water for <number> GOLD to keep the Dragonlord's 
minions away?"

"I will see thee later."

"Thou hast not enough money."

"I am sorry, but I cannot sell thee anymore."

"Here,take this key.
Dost thou wish to purchase more?"

"Magic keys!
They will unlock any door.
Dost thou wish to purchase one for <number> GOLD?"

"I am sorry.
A curse is upon thy body."

"Thou hast no possessions."

"Wilt thou sell anything else?"

"I cannot buy it."

"Thou said the <item>.
I will buy thy <item> for <number> GOLD.
Is that all right?"

"What art thou selling?"

"I will be waiting for thy next visit."

"Dost thou want anything else?"

"Thou cannot hold more Herbs."

"Thou cannot carry anymore."

"Thou hast not enough money."

"The <item>?
Thank you very much."

"What dost thou want?"

"Welcome.
We deal in tools.
What can I do for thee?"

"Oh, yes?
That's too bad."

"Is that Okay.?"

"We deal in weapons and armor.
Dost thou wish to buy anything today?"

"The <item>?"

"Then I will buy thy <item> for <number> GOLD."

"Sorry.
Thou hast not enough money."

"Dost thou wish to buy anything more?"

"What dost thou wish to buy?"

"I thank thee."

"Please, come again."

<player name> chanted the spell of <spell name>.

<player name> cannot yet use the spell.

Thy MP is too low.

But nothing happened.

REPEL has lost its effect.

A torch can be used only in dark places.

<player name> sprinkled the Fairy Water over his body.

The Fairy Water has lost its effect.

The Wings of the Wyvern cannot be used here.

<player name> threw The Wings of the Wyvern up into the sky.

<player name> donned the scale of the dragon.

Thou art already wearing the scale of the dragon.

<player name> blew the Fairies' Flute.

Nothing of use has yet been given to thee.

<player name> put on the Fighter's Ring.

<player name> adjusted the position of the Fighter's Ring.

<player name> held the <item> tightly.

<player name> played a sweet melody on the harp.

<player name> put on the <item> and was cursed!.
Thy body is being squeezed.

The <item> is squeezing thy body.

"Cursed one, be gone!"

"I am looking for the castle cellar.
I heard it is not easily found."

"Thou must have a key to open a door."

"To become strong enough to face future trials thou must first battle many 
foes."

"King Lorik will record thy deeds in his Imperial Scroll so thou may return to 
thy quest later."

"When the sun and rain meet, a Rainbow Bridge shall appear."

"Never does a brave person steal."

"There was a time when Brecconary was a paradise.
Then the Dragonlord's minions came."

"Let us wish the warrior well!"
"May the light be thy strength!"

"If thy Hit Points are high enough, by all means, enter."

"We are merchants who have traveled much in this land.
Many of our colleagues have been killed by servants of the Dragonlord."

"Rumor has it that entire towns have been destroyed by the Dragonlord's 
servants."

"Welcome to Tantegel Castle."

"In Garinham,look for the grave of Garin.
Thou must push on a wall of darkness there."

"A word of advice."
"Save thy money for more expensive armor."

"Listen to what people say.
It can be of great help."

"Beware the bridges!"
"Danger grows when thou crosses."

"There is a town where magic keys can be purchased."

"Some say that Garin's grave is home to a Silver Harp."

"Enter where thou can."

"Welcome!
Enter the shop and speak to its keeper across the desk."

"Thou art most welcome in Brecconary."

"Watch thy Hit Points when in the Poisonous Marsh."

"Go north to the seashore, then follow the coastline west until thou hath 
reached Garinham."

"No,I am not Princess Gwaelin."

"Please,save us from the minions of the Dragonlord."

"See King Lorik when thy experience levels are raised."

"Art thou the descendant of Erdrick?
Hast thou any proof?"

"Within sight of Tantegel Castle to the south is Charlock,"
"The fortress of the Dragonlord."

"This bath cures rheumatism."

"East of Hauksness there is a town, 'tis said, where one may purchase weapons 
of extraordinary quality."

"Rimuldar is the place to buy keys."

"Hast thou seen Nester?
I think he may need help."

"Dreadful is the South Island."
"Great strength and skill and wit only will bring thee back from that place."

"Golem is afraid of the music of the flute, so 'tis said."

"This is the village of Kol."

"In legends it is said that fairies know how to put Golem to sleep."

"The harp attracts enemies.
Stay away from the grave in Garinham."

"I'm too busy.
Ask the other guard."

"I suggest making a map if thy path leads into the darkness."

"Once there was a town called Hauksness far to the south,but I do not know if 
it still exists."

"I hate people!
Go! Leave me!"

"They say that Erdrick's armor was hidden long ago."

"Many believe that Princess Gwaelin is hidden away in a cave."

"I have heard of one named Nester.
Dost thou know such a one?"

"Garin, a wandering minstrel of legendary fame, is said to have built this 
town."

"Welcome to Garinham.
May thy stay be a peaceful one."

"It is said that the Princess was kidnapped and taken eastward."

"Come buy my radishes! They are fresh and cheap.
Buy thy radishes today!"

"To learn how proof may be obtained that thy ancestor was the great Erdrick, 
see a man in this very town."

"'Tis said that Erdrick's sword could cleave steel."

"Welcome to Cantlin, the castle town."

"What shall I get for thy dinner?"

"I know nothing."

"I'm Nester.
Hey, where am I? No, don't tell me!"

"Grandfather used to say that his friend, Wynn, had buried something of great 
value at the foot of a tree behind his shop."

"It is said that many have held Erdrick's armor."
"The last to have it was a fellow named Wynn."

"My Grandfather Wynn once had a shop on the east side of Hauksness."

"Welcome!"

"Who art thou?
Leave at once or I will call my friends."

"I am Orwick, and I am waiting for my girl friend."

"The scales of the Dragonlord are as hard as steel."

"Over the western part of this island Erdrick created a rainbow."
"'Tis also said that he entered the darkness from a hidden entrance in the room 
of the Dragonlord."

"Thou shalt find the Stones of Sunlight in Tantegel Castle,
if thou has not found them yet."

"Welcome to the town of Rimuldar."

"No, I have no tomatoes.
I have no tomatoes today."

"You are <player name>?
It has been long since last we met."

"Good day,I am Howard. Four steps south of the bath in Kol thou shalt find a 
magic item."

"Before long the enemy will arrive."

"Heed my warning! Travel not to the south for there the monsters are fierce and 
terrible."

"In this world is there any sword that can pierce the scales of the 
Dragonlord?"

"Orwick is late again. I'm starving."

"Many have been the warriors who have perished on this quest."
"But for thee I wish success, <player name>."

"Hast thou found the flute?"

"Hast thou been to the southern island?"

"'Tis said that the Dragonlord hath claws that can cleave iron and fiery breath 
that can melt stone."
"Dost thou still wish to go on?"

"This is a magic place.
Hast thou found a magic temple?"

"When entering the cave, take with thee a torch."

"Go to the town of Cantlin."

"I have heard that powerful enemies live there."

"Thou art truly brave."

"In this temple do the sun and rain meet."

"Howard had it, but he went to Rimuldar and never returned."

"To the south, I believe, there is a town called Rimuldar."

"That is good."
"No one will say thou art afraid."

"Go to the south."

"Where oh where can I find Princess Gwaelin?"

"Thank you for saving the Princess."

"Oh, my dearest Gwaelin!"
"I hate thee, <player name>."

"Tell King Lorik that the search for his daughter hath failed."
"I am almost gone...."

"Who touches me?"
"I see nothing, nor can I hear."

"Dost thou know about Princess Gwaelin?"

"Half a year now hath passed since the Princess was kidnapped by the enemy."
"Never does the King speak of it, but he must be suffering much."

"<player name>, please save the Princess."

"Oh, brave <player name>."

"I have been waiting long for one such as thee."

"Thou hast no business here.
Go away."

"If thou art cursed, come again."

"I will free thee from thy curse."

"Now, go."

"Though thou art as brave as thy ancestor, <player name>, thou cannot defeat 
the great Dragonlord with such weapons."
"Thou shouldst come here again."

"Finally thou hast obtained it, <player name>."

"Is that a wedding ring?"
"Thou seems too young to be married."

"All true warriors wear a ring."

"<player name>'s coming was foretold by legend.
May the light shine upon this brave warrior."

"Thou may go and search."

"From Tantegel Castle travel {07}{00} leagues to the south and {04}{00} to the 
east."

"It's a legend."

"Thy bravery must be proven."
"Thus, I propose a test."
"There is a Silver Harp that beckons to the creatures of the Dragonlord."
"Bring this to me and I will reward thee with the Staff of Rain."

"Thou hast brought the harp. Good."

"In thy task thou hast failed. Alas, I fear thou art not the one Erdrick 
predicted would save us."
"Go now!"

"Now the sun and rain shall meet and the Rainbow Drop passes to thy keeping."

"Thou art brave indeed to rescue me, <player name>."
"I am Gwaelin, daughter of Lorik."

"But thou must."

Princess Gwaelin embraces thee.

"I'm so happy!"

"Forever shall I be grateful for the gift of my daughter returned to her home, 
<player name>.
Accept my thanks."
"Now, Gwaelin, come to my side."
Gwaelin then whispers:
"Wait a moment, please.
I would give a present to <player name>."
"Please accept my love, <player name>.

"And I would like to have something of thine--a token."
"Please give me thy <item>."

"Even when we two are parted by great distances, I shall be with thee."

"Farewell, <player name>."

"I love thee, <player name>."

"Dost thou love me, <player name>?"

"When thou art finished preparing for thy departure, please see me.
I shall wait."

"I am greatly pleased that thou hast returned, <player name>."

"Before reaching thy next level of experience thou must gain <number of 
experience>."

"If thou dies I can bring thee back for another attempt without loss of thy 
deeds to date."

"Goodbye now, <player name>.
Take care and tempt not the Fates."

"Will thou take me to the castle?"

"Take the Treasure Chest."

"Welcome, <player name>.
I am the Dragonlord--King of Kings."

"I give thee now a chance to share this world and to rule half of it if thou 
will now stand beside me."
"What sayest thou?
Will the great warrior stand with me?"

"Thou art a fool!"

"Then half of this world is thine, half of the darkness, and...."

Thy journey is over.
Take now a long, long rest.
Hahahaha....

If thou would take the <item>, thou must now discard some other item.
Dost thou wish to have the <item>?

Thou hast given up thy <item>.

What shall thou drop?

Thou hast dropped thy <item>.

And obtained the <item>.

That is much too important to throw away.

<player name> searched the ground all about.

But there found nothing.

There is a treasure box.

<player name> discovers the <item>.

Feel the wind blowing from behind the throne.

There is nothing to take here, <player name>.

Of GOLD thou hast gained <number>

Fortune smiles upon thee, <player name>.
Thou hast found the <item>.

Unfortunately, it is empty.

Heed my voice,
"<player name>, for this is Gwaelin.
To reach the next level thou must raise thy Experience{F0} by <number>.
My hope is with thee.

"From where thou art now, my castle lies{..}

<number> to the north and{..}

<number> to the south and{..}

<number> to the east.

<number> to the west.

A <enemy> draws near!

The <enemy> is running away.

The <enemy> attacked before <player name> was ready.

<player name> attacks!

The <enemy>'s Hit{F0} have been reduced by <number>.

The attack failed and there was no loss of Hit Points!

Command?

That cannot be used in battle.

But that spell hath been blocked.

The spell will not work.

Thou hast put the <enemy> to sleep.

The <enemy>'s spell hath been blocked.

Thou hast done well in defeating the <enemy>.

Thy Experience
increases by <number>.

Thy GOLD
increases by <number>.

Courage and wit have served thee well.
Thou hast been promoted to the next level.

Thou hast learned a new spell.

Quietly Golem closes his eyes and settles into sleep.

<enemy> looks happy.

<player name> started to run away.

But was blocked in front.

<player name> used the Herb.

The <enemy> is asleep.

The <enemy> attacks!

Thy Hit{EF} decreased by <number>.

A miss! No damage hath been scored!

<enemy> chants the spell of <spell>.

<player name>'s spell is blocked.

The <enemy> is breathing fire.

"If thou hast collected all the Treasure Chests,
a key will be found."
"Once used, the key will disappear, but the door will be open and thou may pass 
through."

"East of this castle is a town where armor, weapons, and many other items may 
be purchased."
"Return to the Inn for a rest if thou art wounded in battle, <player name>."
"Sleep heals all."

"Descendant of Erdrick, listen now to my words."
"It is told that in ages past Erdrick fought demons with a Ball of Light."
"Then came the Dragonlord who stole the precious globe and hid it in the 
darkness."
"Now, <player name>, thou must help us recover the Ball of Light and restore 
peace to our land."
"The Dragonlord must be defeated."
"Take now whatever thou may find in these Treasure Chests to aid thee in thy 
quest."
"Then speak with the guards, for they have much knowledge that may aid thee."
"May the light shine upon thee, <player name>."

The tablet reads as follows:

 "I am Erdrick and thou art my descendant."
 "Three items were needed to reach the Isle of Dragons, which is south of 
Brecconary."
 "I gathered these items, reached the island, and there defeated a creature of 
great evil."
 "Now I have entrusted the three items to three worthy keepers."
 "Their descendants will protect the items until thy quest leads thee to seek 
them out."
 "When a new evil arises, find the three items, then fight!"

Excellent move!

"<player name>?
This is Gwaelin.
Know that thou hath reached the final level."

Thou art asleep.

Thou art still asleep.

<player name> awakes.

The <enemy> hath recovered.

It is dodging!

There is no door here.

Thou hast not a key to use.

"Death should not have taken thee, <player name>."
"I will give thee another chance."

Thy power increases by <number>.

Thy Response Speed increases by <number>.

Thy Maximum Hit <points?> increase by <number>.

Thy Maximum Magic <points?> increase by <number>.

"To reach the next level, thy Experience{F0} must increase by <number>."

"Now, go, <player name>!"

"Thou hast failed and thou art cursed."
"Leave at once!"

"...."

"Really?"

"I am glad thou hast returned.
All our hopes are riding on thee."

"See me again when thy level has increased."

The Dragonlord revealed his true self!

Thou hast found the Ball of Light.
Radiance streams forth as thy hands touch the object and hold it aloft.
Across the land spreads the brilliance until all shadows are banished and peace 
is restored.

"The legends have proven true."
"Thou art indeed of the line of Erdrick."
"It is thy right to rule over this land."
"Will thou take my place?"
<player name> thought carefully before answering.
"I cannot,"
said <player name>.
"If ever I am to rule a country, it must be a land that I myself find."

Gwaelin said:
"Please, wait."

"I wish to go with thee on thy journey."

"May I travel as thy companion?"

"Hurrah!
Hurrah!
Long live <player name>!"

"Thou hast brought us peace, again."

"Come now, King Lorik awaits."

And thus the tale comes to an end....
unless the dragons return again.

"Will thou tell me now of thy deeds so they won't be forgotten?"
"Thy deeds have been recorded on the Imperial Scrolls of Honor."

"Dost thou wish to continue thy quest?"
"Rest then for awhile."

"Go <player name>!"

Please push RESET, hold it in, then turn off the POWER.
If you turn the power off first, the Imperial Scroll of Honor containing your 
deeds may be lost.

Unfortunately, NO deeds were recorded on Imperial Scroll number <number>.
